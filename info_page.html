                    <h1>What is Ayurveda?</h1>
                    <p>
                        An all-natural medical system called Ayurveda was developed in India more than 3,000 years ago.
                        The
                        Sanskrit terms ayur (life) and veda are used to form the name "Ayurveda" (science or knowledge).
                        Ayurveda, thus, means "knowledge of life." Ayurveda promotes specific lifestyle interventions
                        and
                        natural remedies to restore harmony between the body, mind, spirit, and environment because it
                        bases its
                        theory on the notion that disease results from an imbalance or stress in a person's
                        consciousness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ayurveda treatment starts with an internal purification process, followed by a special diet,
                        herbal
                        remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In India, Ayurveda is considered a form of medical care, equal to conventional Western medicine,
                        traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathic medicine, and homeopathic medicine. Practitioners of
                        Ayurveda
                        in India undergo state-recognized, institutionalized training. Currently, Ayurvedic
                        practitioners are
                        not licensed in the United States, and there is no national standard for Ayurvedic training or
                        certification. However, Ayurvedic schools have gained approval as educational institutions in
                        some
                        states.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When combined with regular, conventional medical care as a supplemental therapy, ayurveda can be
                        beneficial.

                        In neither Western nor Indian study have many Ayurvedic materials been fully analysed. Some
                        Ayurvedic
                        medicine products contain herbs, metals, minerals, or other substances that could be hazardous
                        if taken
                        incorrectly or without the guidance of a qualified professional. As dietary supplements rather
                        than
                        therapeutics, ayurvedic medicines are not subject to the same safety and efficacy requirements
                        as
                        western pharmaceuticals in the United States. These drugs may interfere with or counteract the
                        effects
                        of western drugs. Look into the education and experience of the Ayurvedic doctors you plan to
                        use.

                    <h1>What is homeopathy?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Homeopathy is a natural form of medicine used by over 200 million people worldwide to treat both
                        acute
                        and chronic conditions. It is based on the principle of ‘like cures like’. In other words, a
                        substance
                        taken in small amounts will cure the same symptoms it causes if taken in large amounts. For
                        example, a
                        patient suffering from hayfever may benefit from the homeopathic remedy Allium Cepa (onion)
                        because it
                        produces similar symptoms such as watery eyes or runny nose.
                    </p>
                    <h1>How Homeopathy helps?</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of the ways that Homeopathy helps is it is designed to treat the whole person and can be
                        helpful in
                        almost any situation where a person's health is depleted. It can also be very useful in the
                        treatment of
                        minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Homeopathy can also helps with long-term problems. Homeopathic doctors often see patients with
                        long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine, such
                        as
                        arthritis, asthma, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, eczema and irritable bowel
                        syndrome.
                        A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic
                        medicine,
                        conventional medicine or a combination of both. As well as doctors there are nurses, midwives,
                        dentists,
                        vets, pharmacists, podiatrists and osteopaths, all using homeopathy in their daily practice.
                    </p>
                    <h1>What are homeopathic medicines made of?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Homeopathic medicines are made from small amounts of natural substances such as plants and
                        minerals.
                        Prepared in licensed laboratories, under strict control, they are usually taken as a tablet but
                        are also
                        available as liquids, powder or creams.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Is Homeopathy safe?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Homeopathy has been practiced worldwide for over 250 years. It is gentle and rarely causes side
                        effects.
                        This means it is suitable for adults, children and pregnant or breastfeeding women
